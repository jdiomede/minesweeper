1/29/12: updated javascript to handle removing the context menu on a right mouse click event, also there is a problem with safari browsers (currently testing version 5.1.2) where a right mouse click is not passed correctly as an event equal to "2"; this issue is still under investigation, in the meantime firefox (currently using version 9.0.1) handles this properly.

Features provided with this html/css/javascript implementation include:
(1) start a new randomly generated game with one of three levels of difficulty
(2) validate the current game (all squares have been exposed, no mines)
(3) cheat and expose all mines (but remain in an active game)
(4) flag potential mines (and protect from selecting the square until the flag is removed)

The game begins as soon as the page loads, or when a new game has been selected with one of the three difficulty levels, however there is no time limit imposed on the user.

Regards,
James
